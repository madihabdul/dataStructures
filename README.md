Projects from Data Structures at Rutgers University Fall 2021

hi future ru data structures students. i think this semester was the first one where they changed all the projectd. great time, but just know its possible to do these projects
without referencing other code. plus doing these projects on your own will make you a WAY better coder, it helped me a lot and i hope you grow from your time at rutgers cs!
