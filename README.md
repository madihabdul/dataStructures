# data structures @ rutgers fall 2021
hi future ru data structures students. i think this semester was the first one where they changed all the projects. great time, but just know its possible to do these projects
without referencing other code. plus doing these projects on your own will make you a WAY better coder, it helped me a lot and i hope you grow from your time at rutgers cs!
