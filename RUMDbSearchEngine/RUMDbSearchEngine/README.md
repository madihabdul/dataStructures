implements separate chaining hash table that stores movie titles with keywords and descriptions, so that anyone can search for relevant movies given keywords like love and tragic, and can get the distance between those two words in a movie description. the trippiest part of this project was working with stuff like ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>. this program can search for movies, find keywords, keyword occurrences and its distances, create hash table, and rehash.
